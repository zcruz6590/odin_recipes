    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Mushrooms & Chicken</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>8 oz. mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 large boneless/skinless chicken breast</li>
        <li>Salt/Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Soup</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 cups low sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons hot sauce, I use Frank's hot sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon toasted sesame seed oil</li>
        <li>2 (3 oz.) packets instant Ramen noodles, don't use flavor packet</li>
        <li>6 leaves Bok Choy, roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Seasonings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon EACH: onion powder, mustard powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For Serving</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Green Onions</li>
        <li>Roughly chopped honey roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>Soft boiled eggs. SEE NOTES</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms. Sauté until golden, about 4 minutes. Remove and set aside so that they retain the color, flavor, and texture.</li>
        <li>Slice the chicken in half lengthwise to create 2 thinner slices. Cover with saran wrap and use the textured side of a meat mallet to pound it to ½ inch thick.</li>
        <li>Pat the chicken dry and season each side with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining olive oil and butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken in batches for 4-5 minutes per side, until a golden crust has developed. Set aside turn the heat off. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then cut into strips of desired size.</li>
        <li>Add the wine and set the heat to medium. Use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the skillet. Let the wine bubble gently and reduce by half, 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and garlic and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth, soy sauce, hot sauce, honey, sesame oil, and soup seasonings. Bring to a gentle boil and let the broth reduce and concentrate for 10 minutes while you soft boil eggs for serving (see notes for instructions).</li>
        <li>Bring the soup to a more rapid boil, add the Ramen, and cook for 1 minute. Reduce to a gentle simmer and add the Bok Choy along with the cooked mushrooms and chicken. Simmer until the noodles are done, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to serving bowls and top with green onions, roughly chopped peanuts, and a soft-boiled egg.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <h4>Soft Boiled Eggs:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Submerge the eggs in 2 inches of cool water in a pot on the stove-top. Gradually bring them to a gentle boil.</li>
        <li>Set a timer for 6 minutes, use a slotted spoon to remove them immediately after.</li>
        <li>Rinse them under cool running water to stop the cooking process, then peel and slice in half lengthwise.</li>
    </ol>
